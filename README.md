### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- The 404 error page was built using Html and css. CSS concepts that I used were flexbox.
- The teams page is heavy on css grid and lots of media queries to make the images really stand out.
- An interior consultant page for an interior decor designer. I've applied some animations in my work for the first time.


## Features

- The 404 page is a proper visual to visitors incase their url does not exist instead of the usual error page.
- The teams page is a grid layout of a creative crew. I really enjoyed this project.
- The interior consultant page has some transition animations that make it appealing to stay in the site.
