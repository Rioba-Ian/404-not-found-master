### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- The 404 error page was built using Html and css. CSS concepts that I used were flexbox.
- The teams page is heavy on css grid and lots of media queries to make the images really stand out.


## Features
